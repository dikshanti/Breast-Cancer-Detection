# Breast-Cancer-Detection

This repository implements a breast cancer detection system using both Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques. The goal is to predict whether a tumor is benign or malignant based on clinical and image data.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Image resizing, normalization, and dataset splitting.
ML Models: Logistic Regression, SVM, and Random Forest.
DL Models: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification.
Data Augmentation: Applied to improve model generalization.
Evaluation: Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.

Technologies
Languages: Python
Libraries: TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Pandas
Development Environment: Jupyter Notebook, Kaggle
